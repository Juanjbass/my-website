                <p> This page provides an overview of my web project and its main purpose. The project was created to demonstrate 
                    the basic structure of a website using HTML and CSS, including navigation, linked pages, and the use of images 
                    and lists. It also follows good design practices like separating style from content and organizing images in their 
                    own folder.</p>
                <p> The web app includes several key features such as navigation buttons, a styled layout, and interactive links that 
                    use tooltips and images as clickable elements. Users can move between pages easily and interact with buttons or image 
                    links. Basic error handling is done by ensuring all links and image paths are valid. Overall, this project shows how HTML, 
                    CSS, and simple interactivity can be combined to create a functional and organized website.</p>
